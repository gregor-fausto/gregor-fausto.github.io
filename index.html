  <p class="lead">I am a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I study plant populations and communities to understand the causes and consequences of genetic and species diversity. I am also working with my advisor, <li><a href="http://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/monica-ann-geber">Monica Geber</a></li>, and collaborator <li><a href="https://biology.duke.edu/people/william-f-morris">Bill Morris</a></li> on a project that incorporates environmental variables and density-dependence into demographic models to predict abundance.
