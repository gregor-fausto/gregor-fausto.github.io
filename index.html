  <p class="lead">I am a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I study the ecology and evolution of plant populations and communities to understand the causes and consequences of genetic and species diversity. I am also working with my advisor, [Monica Geber](http://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/monica-ann-geber), and collaborator [Bill Morris](https://biology.duke.edu/people/william-f-morris) to incorporate environmental variables and density-dependence into demographic models to predict abundance.
