  <p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I mainly study plant populations and try to understand the causes and consequences of variation in life histories. 
  </p>

  <p> I am working on a project that explores patterns of geographic variation in seed dormancy across the range of <i>Clarkia xantiana</i> and investigates potential environmental factors that are correlated with variation in dormancy. I am also working on a project that is focused on understanding how patterns of plant development interact with variation season length to shape life history trade-offs.
  </p>

  <p> Critically examining my own teaching has also led me to be involved with research on how instructional practices and teaching strategies influence student experiences in the classroom, as well as student outcomes such as grades.
