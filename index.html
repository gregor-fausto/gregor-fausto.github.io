  <p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I study plant populations and try to understand the causes and consequences of variation in life histories. 
  </p>

  <p> I am working on a project that incorporates environmental variables and density-dependence into demographic models to predict abundance. I am working with my advisor, <a href="http://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/monica-ann-geber">Monica Geber</a>, and collaborator <a href="https://biology.duke.edu/people/william-f-morris">Bill Morris</a>.
  </p>

    <p> I am also starting a project on the evolution of age and size at flowering. The work is in its early stages, so here are some work-in-progress pictures for the time being.
