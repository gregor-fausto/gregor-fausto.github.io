  <p class="lead">I am a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I study plant populations and communities to understand the causes and consequences of genetic and species diversity.
  </p>

  <p class="lead"> Currently, I am focused on a project that incorporates environmental variables and density-dependence into demographic models to predict abundance. I am working with my advisor, <a href="http://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/monica-ann-geber">Monica Geber</a>, and collaborator <a href="https://biology.duke.edu/people/william-f-morris">Bill Morris</a>. The research is based on data collected annually since 2006 by <a href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/geberlab/">Monica Geber's lab at Cornell University</a>, <a href="https://moellerlab.wordpress.com">Dave Moeller's lab at the University of Minnesota</a>, and <a href="http://web.grinnell.edu/individuals/eckhart/">Vince Eckhart's lab at Grinnell College</a>. A <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1255141&HistoricalAwards=false">grant</a> from the National Science Foundation's program for Long Term Research in Environmental Biology helped fund this work.
