  <p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I study plant populations and communities to understand the causes and consequences of genetic and species diversity. 
  </p>

  <p> Currently, I am focused on a project that incorporates environmental variables and density-dependence into demographic models to predict abundance. I am working with my advisor, <a href="http://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/monica-ann-geber">Monica Geber</a>, and collaborator <a href="https://biology.duke.edu/people/william-f-morris">Bill Morris</a>.
